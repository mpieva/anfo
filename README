Consider this a working prototype.  The program maps and aligns, is
configurable to some extent, but not quite as versatile as planned.

The most glaring omission is the simplistic aligner (linear gap costs
and no aDNA model), followed by the fact that only one genome is
searched against.  The code is also a bit unclean (too much in a single
file/function).

For what it's worth, this version is fit for a large scale test.

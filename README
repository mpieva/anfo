Where to start?

Get the prerequisites, compile, create documentation, test.

Prerequisites are...

 - Not too ancient G++; 4.0 and later work fine, 3.x might cause some
   difficulties.  Also make, a shell, and so on.

 - protobuf.  Find it at http://code.google.com/p/protobuf. 

 - Judy.  Find it at http://judy.sf.net or ask your friendly admin.

 - popt.  You might already have it, else ask your admin or grab it at
   http://rpm5.org/files/popt/

 - Doxygen, if you want the documentation.  Can be found at http://doxygen.org

If you have those, call 'make', then 'make doc' to create the documentation.


How to use it?

To test, you need a genome, an index, and some input in FASTA or FASTQ format.
Genomes and indices are littered everywhere (/ltmp/anfo at Garching,
/var/tmp/udo on bionc02), but here's how to do it yourself:

 - Locate a genome in FASTA format (or any other format that has a converter;
   2bit is fine, my own .dna isn't (yet)).  Run fa2dna on it (--help tells you
   how); you can pipe the input if you want.

 - On your new .dna file, run file-info.  It should spit out the meta data for
   that genome.  If now, you're hosed...

 - Build an index for the .dna file using dnaindex.  Choosing an
   appropriate word size is the only parameter that really matters.

 - You can run file-info on that, too.  It well tell you the word size
   you just set.

 - Write a sensible anfo.cfg using the example and config.proto as
   guideline.

 - You could run index-test now.  It maps a single sequence that has a
   reasonable hit to human chromosome 21.  If it produces a segfault or
   nonsense, something is fucked up.

 - anfo-standalone can be run on any FASTA/FASTQ file now.  No offically
   blessed, "correct" sets of output exist, yet.


What's stable and what isn't?

Pretty much stabilized are...

 - Genome handling and creation (files sequence.h, sequence.cc, index.h, index.cc, fa2dna.cc)

   I store genomes with four bits per nucleotide, which sounded like a fucking
   brilliant idea, since it's only half as wasteful as the text form and still
   allows ambiguity code.  The headaches came with the implementation of the
   auxilliary DnaP class...  Anyway, the nucleotides A,C,T,G map to bits
   0,1,2,3.  That order (you did notice T coming before G, didn't you?) also
   sounded like a fucking brilliant idea, but in realilty it doesn't matter and
   I keep forgetting.  Chromosomes are split at long stretches of Ns into
   contigs, contigs are separated by gaps and the first and last ones terminate
   in a gap at either side.

 - Index handling and creation (files index.h, index.cc, dnaindex.cc)

   The index is quite simple: oligos are mapped to integers, a first array
   contains a pointer to a second array for each of the possible oligos, and
   the second array contains one long list of positions where these oligos were
   found.  Only the forward strand is indexed, but lookup is of course done for
   both strands.  (This primitive thing seems such a waste when the much better
   FM-index is just out of reach... to bad, for now.)

 - Handling of reads (files sequence.h and sequence.cc)

   Just a compact format for sequences with quality scores and a FASTA/FASTQ
   reader.  There's no support for unmerged mate pairs, I haven't evan decided
   what to do with them.

 - File formats (genome, index, config file, output)

   Genome and index files are documented somewhere in the code.  Metadata,
   config, complex output, etc. is encapsulated in protobuf messages.  That way
   I don't need to mess with parsers and pretty printers and the messages are
   extensible.  The two .proto files are more or less finalized, but it's easy
   to change them without breaking stuff.


Somewhat less stable:

 - The aligner (align.h, align.cc)

   In principle, this code is in it's final form, it is supposed to do what was
   planned, and it works in principle.  However, I do get memory corruption and
   segfaults (rarely, but I get them), so I suspect there's something fishy
   going on in there.  Also, the general structure and the specific alignment
   mechanisms could be separated from each other.


Royal mess:

 - the main program (anfo-standalone.cc) and aux. tools (anfo-type, file-info)

   These have just grown.  The aux. tools might work the way they are or may
   change chape; just treat them as debugging aid.  The main program was never
   planned (the original plan is to have a set of interconnected, networked
   services), but I'm afraid we're stuck with it for the time being.  Parts of
   it should be abstracted out, especially the interfaces to the indexer(s) and
   aligner(s) are absolutely unclean.  Oh well...
